<h5>Children are our future. They are what we love most and we want what is best for them. Children are at their most vulerable because their brain are developing, are likely to make mistakes, and are extremely impressionable. That is why it is the best time for them to find ways to deal with the difficulties of the world now. In therapy we can go over area in their lives they are struggling with, work on emotional regulation, conqure our grief, learn ways to handle stress, and much more. Not only will therapy benefit them now, but for the rest of their lives!</h5>

        <h2>FAQ: </h2>

        <div class="contain"> 
          <div class="label"><b>Should my child attend therapy even if they do not have a mental illness?</b></div>
          <div class="content">Therapy is not only focused on mental illnesses. In children's therapy we work on many things based on their lives now and other things that may affect them. If your child has anger issues, emotional regulation exercises may be helpful. Or maybe your child is not sharing what is wrong at school with you and you need a trusted adult to help them with troubles in their lifes. We have programs for many things. Some of these programs include but are not limited to: grief, divorice, stress, time mangagement, gaining a postive mindset, and understanding themselves. It is important to keep in mind, that while your child does not have a mental illness visible now, this does not mean that this will be true later in life. Going to therapy can help them laern ways to fight off mental illnesses that may try to enter their lives. Sometimes even then we cannot stop them, but find ways for them not to rule our lives.</div>

        <div class="contain">
          <div class="label"><b>What are mental illnesses?</b></div>
          <div class="content">According to the American Psychiatric Association, "mental illnesses are health conditions involving changes in emotion, thinking or behavior (or a combination of these). Mental illnesses can be associated with distress and/or problems functioning in social, work or family activities."</div>

        <div class="contain">
          <div class="label"><b>What occurs during these sessions?</b></div>
          <div class="content">Sessions are based on what you and your child want to work on with my guidance and expertise. Keep in mind, different children may have different programs even if they are in the same family. My program is usually based on a child-centered play therapy, Cognitive Behavioral therapy (CBT), meditation/ breathing exercises, and you can even sign them up for social skill groups. Social skill groups will be put on the calendar and social media accounts to inform you when they will occur and what they are focusing on. </div>

          <div class="label"><b>Can I book multiple of my children in the same session?</b></div>
          <div class="content">Yes! Keep in mind, that sometimes it is benefical for children to have seperate sessions. If one of your hopes is to have your children connect and work on difficulties with each other, this may be what they need. If you are wondering if your child would do well to have a session with their sibling feel free to contact me and let me know of yor circumstances. </div>
