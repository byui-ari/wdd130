        Welcome! My name is Arianna and I have completed my training as a licensed children's therapist (when I use this website this will hopefully be true), and I am here to help your child! You and your child will decide what to focus on in these sessions with my expertise. I am certified to work with children who have disabilities such as depression, anxiety, ADHD, etc. If you have any questions, feel free to look at my FAQ area of the website which can be found on the therapy tab. If your questions are not answered in this section, feel free to contact me. You can either find it on the booking tab or at the bottom on the page that says contact us! I will try and get back to you as soon as I can. Have a great week!

      <h3>Children's Mental Health (Page 2)</h3>
      <p>
        Children are our future. They are what we love most and we want what is best for them. Children are at their most vulerable because their brain are developing, are likely to make mistakes, and are extremely impressionable. That is why it is the best time for them to find ways to deal with the difficulties of the world now. In therapy we can go over area in their lives they are struggling with, work on emotional regulation, conqure our grief, learn ways to handle stress, and much more. Not only will therapy benefit them now, but for the rest of their lives! 
      </p>
      <p>
        FAQ: 
        <br>+ Should my child attend therapy even if they do not have a mental illness? 
        <br>      Therapy is not only focused on mental illnesses. In children's therapy we work on many things based on their lives now and other things that may affect them. If your child has anger issues, emotional regulation exercises may be helpful. Or maybe your child is not sharing what is wrong at school with you and you need a trusted adult to help them with troubles in their lifes. We have programs for many things. Some of these programs include but are not limited to: grief, divorice, stress, time mangagement, gaining a postive mindset, and understanding themselves. It is important to keep in mind, that while your child does not have a mental illness visible now, this does not mean that this will be true later in life. Going to therapy can help them laern ways to fight off mental illnesses that may try to enter their lives. Sometimes even then we cannot stop them, but find ways for them not to rule our lives. 
        <br>+ What are mental illnesses? 
        <br>      According to the American Psychiatric Association, "mental illnesses are health conditions involving changes in emotion, thinking or behavior (or a combination of these). Mental illnesses can be associated with distress and/or problems functioning in social, work or family activities." 
        <br>+ What occurs during these sessions? 
        <br>      Sessions are based on what you and your child want to work on with my guidance and expertise. Keep in mind, different children may have different programs even if they are in the same family. My program is usually based on a child-centered play therapy, Cognitive Behavioral therapy (CBT), meditation/ breathing exercises, and you can even sign them up for social skill groups. Social skill groups will be put on the calendar and social media accounts to inform you when they will occur and what they are focusing on. 
        <br>+ Can I book multiple of my children in the same session? 
        <br>      Yes! Keep in mind, that sometimes it is benefical for children to have seperate sessions. If one of your hopes is to have your children connect and work on difficulties with each other, this may be what they need. If you are wondering if your child would do well to have a session with their sibling feel free to contact me and let me know of yor circumstances. 
        <br>+ Should my child bring anything with them? 
        <br>      I ask that in our first session your child brings a filled out questionaire that is shared to your email and/or can be found in the booking section unless you have already emailed it to me. If your child would like to bring something else like stuffed animal, they are free to. 
        <br>+ What are your pricing for a session? 
        <br>      Pricing can be found below and on he booking section. 
        <br>+ What type of methods do you use? 
        <br>      My methods are based on age and what we are focusing on for your child. This may include play therapy, Cognitive Behavioral therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavior therapy, group therapy, social skill groups. Social skill groups and group therapy will be put on the calendar and social media accounts to inform you when they will occur and what they are focusing on. I will be adding more about this in the future. So, keep an eye out! 
        <br>+ Are sessions covered by my insurance? 
        <br>      Numerous plans usually cover therapy vists including group therapy for your children. Usually companies like Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield, Aetna, United HealthCare, Medicare, Medicaid, and many more now a days have coverage for mental health. If you have concerned about you insurance plan not paying for it contact your insurance provider or ask me and I will try to find out.
