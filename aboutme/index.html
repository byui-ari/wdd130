    <p style="width:600px;">Hello everyone! I am from Virginia, but will be moving to the Idaho area soon. I have four sisters and one brother. One of these sisters is my identical twin. She is the one with me in the picture. We also recently had a new addition to the family, our niece (she is adorable)! My major is psychology and as of now my minor is computer information technology. I am between a few careers, but my top choice is a children's therapist. I enjoy reading, dancing, spending time in nature, and spending time with my family. Have a great semester! </p>
